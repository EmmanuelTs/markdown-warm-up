### funny story

when I traveled to Congo , we flew by Luanda (capital of Angola) because there was a transit there and looking outside the window I saw many bright lights shining (from birdview) because it was evening  
but when we finally landed in Kinshasha (capital of Congo) everything was dark , almost no lights shining it was kind of funny to see (and kind of depressing too) how neighbooring countries can differ so much in certain kinds of developments.

##### tl;dr 
the (not so) funny contrast of no lights in Kinshasha, many bright lights in Angola
